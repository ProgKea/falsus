*WARNING THIS SOFTWARE IS UNFINISHED*

* Falsus

Falsus is a apprenticeship journal generator (You could also modify it to do something else) that takes a text file with a specific [[id:a287f2f2-5927-4040-9d1d-f5ffece635ba][format]] and uses that file to create a latex file in the specified directory.
This project uses a slightly modified version of this latex template: https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/LaTeX-Vorlage-Berichtsheft by [[https://github.com/MarkusAmshove][Markus Amshove]].

Falsus adjusts the date and the numbering of the reports accordingly.
The month it starts counting from is currently hard coded but this is going to change in the near future (or you could change it yourself by editing the [[file:src/config.h][config.h]] file).

** Getting started

To start using Falsus you need to compile it first using the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC console
$ make
#+END_SRC
You should also have some knowledge about how to use LaTeX.

*** Running the program

To generate your latex file run the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC console
$ ./falsus <report_file> <output_directory>
#+END_SRC
This will produce the latex files and a =include_report= file which you should include inside the =Berichtsheft.tex= file.

To produce a PDF use the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC console
$ pdflatex Berichtsheft.tex
#+END_SRC

*** Nix

If you are on Nix you can install the utilize the flake.nix file using the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC console
$ nix develop
#+END_SRC

** File format
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a287f2f2-5927-4040-9d1d-f5ffece635ba
:END:

| Number of newlines | action |
|--------------------+--------|
| 1 | new item inside a week |
| 2 | new week |
| 3 | new section (school section or company section) |
| 4 | new report |

** Example

This example is in german, since it's my native language.

For example the file [[file:latex/beispiel_berichte.txt][beispiel_berichte.txt]] would produce the following pdf:

[[file:images/Berichtsheft-0.png]]
[[file:images/Berichtsheft-1.png]]

** What advantages does this have?

- It's faster
- no more tedious counting of dates
- You can edit every page at once
- focus solely on the content instead of the appearance
